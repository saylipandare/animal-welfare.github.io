					<h2>RESCUE VICTOR</h2>
					<p>
						<strong>Location: </strong>Bulgaria<br>
						<strong>Species saved: </strong>street cat<br>
						Victors story is not for the faint-hearted. In mid-June 2020, this beautiful two-year-old male cat was found hiding under the hood of a car, on the streets of Bankya, Bulgaria in an extremely serious condition. 

                        Poor Victor had ghastly injuries, he had an open fracture with exposed bone on one of his front legs, with necrosis of this toes as well as deep abrasions on the muzzle, pelvis and hind leg. His life was hanging in the balance when he was brought to our clinic for stray animals in the areas. 

                        His body was under a lot of stress and so it took several days before the vets were able to stabilise Victors condition, so that he was strong enough to undergo surgery. When he was strong enough, surgery could not save his front leg but put him on the beginning of his long road to recovery. Following, the long-term medical treatment, changing of bandages and treatment of many wounds begun.

					<h2>STRAY ANIMAL CARE</h2>
					<p>
						<strong>Location: </strong>BULGARIA<br>
						<strong>Species saved: </strong>Stray Dogs<br>
						Since 2008, the Animal Protection Law in Bulgaria has prohibited culling as a control method for stray dog populations. However, many municipalities do not have the resources to carry out stray animal neutering activities, and there is little local enforcement preventing pet abandonment. For these reasons, there is still a struggle for humane management of stray animal populations.

					<h2>ANIMAL ASSISTED INTERVENTION (AAI)</h2>
					<p>
						<strong>Location: </strong>india.<br>
						<strong>Species saved: </strong>stray dogs<br>
						Developed to benefit both animals and people, our AAI programme aims to change people’s attitude towards stray dogs by emphasising their societal value as therapy and companion dogs. One of the desired side effects is that through a change in perspective about stray dogs, people would also consider adopting strays as companion animals.

                        In an effort to prove that stray dogs can be an immense asset to the society, FOUR PAWS became the first organisation to launch an Animal Assisted Intervention (AAI) programme in which former stray dogs are selected, trained and certified by experts to become therapy dogs. 

                        Within the AAI programme, Animal Assisted Therapy (AAT) is a type of complementary therapy that involves guided interaction with animals to facilitate healing and rehabilitation of patients with acute or chronic disease. It is believed to have an array of benefits, including personal and social development, increased self-esteem, improved mental health, better social skills and increased empathy and nurturing skills.

					<h2>COVID-19 AND STRAY ANIMALS</h2>
					<p>
						<br>
						<strong>Species saved: </strong>stray dogs and cats<br>
						COVID-19 has affected both people and animals alike around the world. As lockdown and physical distancing measures are enacted, more people are staying home, while restaurants and most markets are closed – both vital food sources for stray animals! The effect on stray animals is devastating as most are finding it increasingly difficult to find food. 

                        In Eastern Europe, our teams are seeing increased desperation of thin strays searching day and night for their next meal. Whilst food isn’t the only struggle strays face in Southeast Asia, with the economic situation worsening, the theft of dogs and cats for the brutal meat trade is becoming more rampant.

                        The intake of animals abandoned at shelters is also increasing day by day, either with the mistaken belief that animals can pass on COVID-19, or that the virus has left owners unable to care for them.

                        These challenging times call for urgent measures. FOUR PAWS is giving dogs and cats a lifeline, by feeding stray animals wherever possible, campaigning to end the dog and cat meat trade and addressing the challenging situations faced by local shelters.
